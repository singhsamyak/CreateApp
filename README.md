# CreateApp

This is just a simple script that helps me get started with a new app using:
  - Redux for state management.
  - React for the interface.
  - Jest for unit testing.
  - Webpack to put everything together.

# Dude, Why?

I was tired of starting from scratch everytime I worked on a new project. The configs, meta files, and directory structure are always similar, and the dependencies don't really change much. CreateApp creates a basic container to get started on a project, and it saves me a lot of time!

# Usage

```
cd createApp
source ./init.sh ~/path/to/your/app/MyApp
```
